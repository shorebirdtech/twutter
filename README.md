# twutter

Using Twitter as an example to demonstrate what a front-to-back app
built on Shorebird could look like.

An instance is live at: https://shimmer-c3juc.ondigitalocean.app/

# Notes

## Dependencies to remove
- dockerfiles -- move to shorebird (will require github action?)
- bin/server.dart -- move into a shorebird tool?
- gen directory -- make autogenerated (shorebird tool?)
- dependency_override on shorebird -- remove
- dependency on json_serializable -- replace with shorebird annotation?
- remove or autogenerate fromDbJson and toDbJson methods

## Easy cleanup
- Add color to user profile
- center views on large screens.

## Missing features
- Separate per-user timelines.
- Profile pages
- Ability to follow/unfollow.
- Image support (profile images, media in flaps, etc).
- Pull-to-refresh to timeline page
- Notifications
- Likes
- Reflaps
- Search
- No way to migrate the database when editing model classes.

## Bugs
- /home and other routes don't actually check for login.
- Session is not persisted locally.
- Sessions on the server are fake (and not persisted).
- Possible to create duplicate users.
- Timezones are not handled properly (server time should be utc and authoratative).

## Questions?
- Can we delete the backend directory?
- Can the compiler just decide what parts go where and find the async boundary
  to cut at?
- e.g. @trusted annotation
- Authorization should be expressed in the type system, e.g. AuthorizedContext.


## Pain
* When you forget return Response.ok() from handler, you get:
Error thrown by handler.
type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'FutureOr<Response>'
package:shelf/src/middleware/logger.dart 30:62  logRequests.<fn>.<fn>.<fn>
* When you make a change to the server you want both it and the client to hotreload.
* No support for renaming fields in database.
* Want to see the output from client and server in one log?
* Sembast methods will happily accept 'db' (instead of 'txn') inside a transcation callback and then just hang.  Need some sort of lint to catch that.
* Had to set up my own custom docker images (there is only one flutter image, from cirrusci).
* Had to use the "flutter" image for the backend, because dart pub get can't fetch a pubspec.yaml that mentions flutter.
* Building docker files takes *minutes*
* Not clear how you have multi-repo packages with dependencies.  When you pull them from git, relative path dependencies don't work.
* CORS headers are a pain. Can you force localhost to have them?
* Getting the docker image deployed with the correct ports was a pain.
* Separate docker images for client and server make for long builds.
